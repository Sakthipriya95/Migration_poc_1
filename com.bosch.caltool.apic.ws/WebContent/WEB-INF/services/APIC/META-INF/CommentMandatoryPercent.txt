Percentage of all filled mandatory attributes over all levels. 
The number of mandatory items can be different from PIDC to PIDC because
attributes might be entered on different levels with a different number of
variants and sub-variants. Thus, the percentage can be used to compare
the degree of filling mandatory attributes.

For example:
PIDC 1 has three variants. Attribute 1 is maintained on variant level. This
means, attribute 1 has to be entered three times.
PIDC 2 has no variants. Attribute 1 is maintained on PIDC level. This
means, attribute 1 has to be entered once.
