The number of mandatory attributes that have to be filled for the level <level>. 

The number of mandatory attributes to be filled can be different due to:
- the number of variants and/or subvariants with mandatory attributes
- differences due to attribute dependencies

Only on PIDC level it is possible to have an overall maximum number of
mandatory attributes -> this is the number of defined mandatory attributes.
On variant and subvariant level the maximum number of attributs depends on the project 
structure.
