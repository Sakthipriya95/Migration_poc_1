Mandatory attributes with value on PIDC level. 

For example: 3 (4)

The first number shows the mandatory attributes with value (also if the value
is <Variant> or <Sub-Variant>. The second number in brackets shows the max.
possible mandatory attributes for this PIDC.

How this attribute might be maintained on Variant or Sub-Variant level 
is not considered.
For example:

Attribute 1: No Value on PIDC
Attribute 2: Value "Test"
Attribute 3: <Variant>
Attribute 4: <Sub-Variant>
(Attribute 5: )

Of these five attributes 2-4 would be considered as filled. Attribute 2 
has a value, 3 and 4 are maintained on a lower level. If they are 
really maintained on  a lower level is not ensured.
Attribute 5 is a mandatory attribute that has dependencies, thus it is 
not considered. That means, the number
of possible mandatory attributes can be different from PIDC to PIDC.
The output for the upper five attributes would be: 3 (4)
