Percentage of all filled mandatory attributes over all levels. 
A percentage and not an absolute number is shown, because the number
of mandatory attributes can be different depending on the number of variants 
and sub-variants.

For example:
PIDC 1 has three variants. Attribute 1 is maintained on variant level. This
means, attribute 1 has to be entered three times.
PIDC 2 has no variants. Attribute 1 is maintained on PIDC level. This
means, attribute 1 has to be entered once.

Note: There are mandatory attributes that have not fulfilled dependencies. 
They are not considered for a percentage. That means, the number
of possible mandatory attributes can be different from PIDC to PIDC.
